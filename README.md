Android App to estimate taxi fare in India
This is a very basic android appplication utilizing Google Maps APIs to calculate the average distance between
origin and destination and estimate the taxi fare.
It calculates fares based on data available from indian operators due to large number of independent taxi/rickshaw operators.
My goal with this app is to prevent cheating of consumers by certain taxi drivers.
